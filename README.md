# Login-Logout

In this project you will see how to login and logout using sessions and cookies. First page will be signup page in which you can upload your profile pic and complete the form to get registered and then you can sign in and logout using that username and password. The credentials you entered will be authenticated using data stored in database of that user.
And there is option remember me during sign-in if you checked the box than in case you mistakenly removed the tab in browser you can login just by clicking sign-in button and not to enter credentials again.
